    - Renders a given template
        - Context containing parameters captured in the URL
    - Used when you want to present some information on an HTML page

    - Shouldn’t be used when your page has forms and does creation or update of objects

    - TemplateView is most suitable
        - Static and hardly need any context
        - Showing pages that work with GET requests and don’t have forms in them
